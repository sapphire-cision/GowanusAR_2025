# GowanusAR_2025

This Unity project represents the Shipping & Remediation scene of [GowanusAR](https://www.sarahdrury.net/work/augmented-gowanus), a site-specific augmented reality experience developed for the 2025 City of Water Day tour in Gowanus, Brooklyn. Designed to run smoothly on mobile devices via [App Store deployment](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gowanusar/id6747295340), the scene allows users to explore the industrial and ecological past of Gowanus Canalâ€™s shipping history through immersive, locative AR.

Using physical markers and site-specific triggers, this scene overlays:
- Animated 3D objects and environmental effects
- Voiceover / textual narration and speculative commentary
- Spatialized audio and ambient soundscapes
- Haptic feedback for selected interactions
- Interactive behaviors, including:
  - Walking around AR content for different angles/perspectives
  - Tapping objects to activate animations or audio layers
  - Moving through zones to trigger scene transitions

The scene is built to invite users into a hybrid physical-virtual exploration of invisible urban transformations, particularly the entangled processes of commerce, pollution, remediation, and displacement. While based in real-world locations, the narrative deliberately zooms in and out, ranging from microcosmic textures (e.g. sediment animations) to macrosocial themes (e.g. gentrification and climate futures).

# Notes

This repo contains the final shipping scene only. Other GowanusAR scenes (e.g., Underground Waterway prototype, Turning Basin, Salt Lot) exist in separate Unity projects and are not currently included here.
